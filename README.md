# Data Quality Characterization Tool for Fitness Tracker Data: Focusing on Fitness-for-Use Measures

## Abstract
Data Quality is commonly defined as fitness-for-use which means that the quality of data is dependent on users’ needs or a specific task. Therefore, assessing data quality can be subjective and researchers without the domain knowledge on a specific data type may face challenges in assessing fitness-for-use.

Currently, there are data quality tools that support the characterization of data quality. However, existing tools generally provide descriptive statistics on the quality of data such as percent missingness which are measures not specific to a certain research question. These tools provide limited information on whether the data would be fit for your task.

We designed an interactive R Shiny dashboard that can support the assessment of fitness-for-use by incorporating data quality dimensions and measures that researchers consider when assessing the quality of fitness tracker data for their research. The core features include (1) subsetting the data to define cohort of interest, (2) summarizing data (including metadata) on cohort of interest, (3) defining ‘completeness’ that fits users’ task, and (4) summarizing data on cohort of interest that meets the completeness definition.
